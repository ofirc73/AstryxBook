# Astryxbook

Android wrapper around m.facebook.com (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose,
compose-webview-multiplatform, Media3). Package `com.eepiemi.materialbook`,
applicationId `com.astryx.book`. Fork-specific changes are documented in
`FORK_CHANGES.md` (upstream's own log is `CHANGE.md`); update it with every
user-visible change.

## Build, install, test (Windows / PowerShell)

- Release build for a device: `.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease "-PversionNameOverride=99.99.N"`.
  The quotes are required in PowerShell. A plain local build is `versionCode`
  13, lower than the installed app, so `adb install -r` needs the override
  (bump N for each install).
- Debug builds install as a separate app (`com.astryx.book.test`). Use it
  for device checks when the phone has an official (release-key) build:
  a local release APK won't install over it. `connectedDebugAndroidTest`
  uninstalls that app when it finishes (losing its Facebook login), so run
  instrumented tests before or after a device session, not in the middle.
- `.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest` (use the variant task; `--tests` filtering
  doesn't work on plain `test`), `.\gradlew.bat connectedDebugAndroidTest`
  (needs a device), `.\gradlew.bat lintDebug`. CI (`ci.yml`) gates on
  `test`, `:app:lintDebug` and `connectedAndroidTest`.
- Pushing to `main` runs `create-release.yml` (which calls `ci.yml`); it
  auto-versions from conventional commits (`feat:` = minor bump) and
  publishes a release. A docs-only push (`*.md`, `LICENSE`, `fastlane/`,
  `assets/`) skips it via `paths-ignore`.

## WebView and PiP code (`ui/screens/MaterialbookWV.kt`)

- compose-webview's navigator replays only its *last* event to a WebView that
  isn't attached yet. Never call `navigator.evaluateJavaScript` unconditionally
  at composition: guard on `state.loadingState is LoadingState.Finished` or a
  trigger counter `> 0`, or it replaces the initial `loadUrl` and the page
  never loads.
- Native -> JS uses Compose trigger counters/state passed from `MainActivity`
  into `MaterialbookWebView`; JS -> native uses `PipBridge`.
- PiP focus mode (`PIP_FOCUS_MODE_JS` / `PIP_RESTORE_MODE_JS`) was tuned
  through live DevTools sessions and is covered by `PipFocusModeJsTest`. Never
  restyle or resize the video's ancestor elements: Facebook's reels controller
  watches them and pauses the reel. Add new PiP behaviour as separate scripts
  and effects instead of editing focus mode.
- The page scripts in `res/raw` (except the PiP ones loaded directly in
  `MaterialbookWV.kt`) are fetched at runtime from `main` on GitHub
  (`SCRIPT_SRC` in `fetchScripts.kt`), falling back to the bundled copy. A
  push to `main` changes them in every installed app on its next launch, and
  a local build still runs `main`'s version of a script that exists there.
- Messages in desktop mode opens `MessagesLayer` (`ui/screens/MessagesLayer.kt`), a
  second WebView with the desktop user agent over the main one. The main view never
  switches user agent for Messages; Facebook pages opened from a chat stay in the layer
  (`messagesLayerRoute`). Each WebView is a separate DevTools target.
- `m.facebook.com` redirects full loads of some pages (profiles) to
  `intent://…;package=com.facebook.katana;S.browser_fallback_url=…`; the interceptors open
  the web fallback (`intentFallbackUrl`). Never launch the app an `intent://` link names.
- `state.nativeWebView` throws until the WebView exists (it's created during layout, which
  doesn't happen with the screen off): guard it in effects.
- Instrumented tests reset the debug app's settings (not its Facebook login).
- All PiP, lock-screen audio and fullscreen logs use the tag `AstryxbookPiP`:
  `adb logcat AstryxbookPiP:D *:S`.
- `WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)` is unconditional on purpose.
  Live debugging on the device: forward `localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>`
  and use the DevTools protocol (`/json`, `Runtime.evaluate`).

- Facebook's video viewer re-lays out only on a real fullscreen transition
  (`fullscreenchange`), not on `resize`/`orientationchange`, and writes its
  widths into inline styles. Chromium ends HTML5 fullscreen by itself when
  PiP starts from landscape (see `PIP_HOLD_FULLSCREENCHANGE_JS`).

## Facebook behaviour, not ours

Verify against Chrome/Opera on the phone before "fixing" these: Reels can
re-pause a resumed video; finished videos auto-advance (and leave
fullscreen). A real landscape page is broken on Facebook's side (reel skip
on rotation, oversized still frame after leaving fullscreen), which is why
phones are held in portrait except during fullscreen video and while the
Messages layer is open (`appOrientation`). See Known
limitations in `FORK_CHANGES.md`.

## Repo housekeeping

- Plan files (`*_PLAN.md`) and `spike.log` are working notes; don't commit them.
- The `stats` branch is data-only (weekly release download counts written by
  `download-stats.yml`); never merge it into `main`.
- On Windows, `git worktree remove` can fail with "Filename too long"; delete
  the folder with PowerShell, then `git worktree prune`.
